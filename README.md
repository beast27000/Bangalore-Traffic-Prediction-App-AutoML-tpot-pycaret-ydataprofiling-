# Project Summary   ( Pls note: main7.py is the primary working project)

This project predicts traffic volume in Bangalore using advanced machine learning techniques and tools. It preprocesses a dataset with traffic and environmental factors, trains models, and provides predictions through an interactive Streamlit app. With AutoML tools like PyCaret and TPOT, the project ensures high accuracy and streamlined pipeline optimization.


# Key Features:

Predicts traffic volume based on multiple factors like area, weather, and road conditions.

Includes a dataset with 4,000+ samples and extensive preprocessing.

Leverages AutoML with PyCaret for model comparison and TPOT for pipeline optimization.

Provides an interactive Streamlit app for uploading data and generating predictions.

Offers downloadable prediction results for further analysis.

# Modules Used:

PyCaret: Automated machine learning and model comparison.

TPOT: Genetic programming for optimized machine learning pipelines.
